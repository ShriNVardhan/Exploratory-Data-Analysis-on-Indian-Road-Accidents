# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Indian-Road-Accidents

The project involved conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset compiled from manual records of road traffic accidents spanning the years 2017–2022. 
This project was done entirely on Python using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

• Utilized Pandas for data loading, cleaning, and exploration to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
• Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visually appealing plots and charts to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the accident data.
